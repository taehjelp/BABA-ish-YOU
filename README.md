# BABA-ish-YOU
a bad BABA is YOU clone&lt;3 my beloved&lt;3

my first attempt at making an app, as I'm sure you can tell from a variety of questionable decisions! 
maybe I'll add a proper readme at some point, for now this is more of a note to self on how to actually get this badboy to run, if you're lucky:)

make sure maven is installed and path stuff is sorted out

run BABAapp.java to open the app

if you get complaints starting with "Exception in Application start method
java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException", try heading to line 12 in BABAapp, add and remove a character in "/BABAishYOU.fxml", run again

if you get complaints about finding images, ensure that the file path doesn't have a double layer of BABA-ish-YOU-main. if that is the case, move the innermost BABA-ish-YOU-main out of the outer folder and try again:)
