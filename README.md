# BABA-ish-YOU
a bad BABA is YOU clone&lt;3 my beloved&lt;3

my first attempt at making an app (and first project in general), as I'm sure you can tell from a variety of questionable decisions! 
maybe I'll add a proper readme at some point, for now this is more of a note to self on how to actually get this badboy to run, if you're lucky

make sure maven is installed and path stuff is sorted out

run BABAapp.java to open the app

if you get complaints about finding images, ensure that the file path doesn't have a double layer of BABA-ish-YOU-main folders. if that is the case make sure to open the innermost BABA-ish-YOU-main folder in your editor, try again. you'll also get image issues if theres a parenthesis anywhere in the file path:)

if you get complaints starting with "Exception in Application start method
java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException", try adding and removing a character anywhere in BABAapp.java, run again. might just be a "vscode hates java" issue! no I'm not going to download intellij, I don't plan on doing more java work anytime soon :3

WASD is MOVE  
R is RESET  
C is SAVE  
V is LOAD  
B is BONK  
BABA ish YOU
